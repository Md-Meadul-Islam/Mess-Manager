## About Mess Manager

#### Purposes: 
If you are staying in a rented room and there many room-mates under one room manager, you can use this application to maintain all room-mates meals and bazar lists. In this application have Meals Table that contain all room-mates with manager's daily meal list (like breakfast, lunch, dinner), you can just edit and update a specific date's meal data to store record. And have Bazar Table that contain all bazar list in-details(product_name, weight, price) and totals for a specific mates/users. Finally, in Dashboard page's you can view total-meals, total-bazars, all room-mates of a month.

Develop a Mess Manager application using bootstrap and custom JavaScript for responsive and modern UI design. In Backend I use Laravel with blade. Used Laravel Breeze package as authentication system for registration and login.

##Key Features: 
By Default, every user will be manager/roommate when they registered for the first time. a user can select his role in a room/mess. If selected role is roommate, then user must be give their manager email and phone for connect with manager.
In my application Manager is Administrator of a room/mess. He can see all roommates for a selected month and can change the roommateâ€™s role from manager to roommate. Only he can Update or edit or delete Meal data and Bazars data. Roommate only view their Meal/Bazars data, for modification(update/edit) he can send request to the manager for modificationâ€™s.
#### Dashboard: 
     1. You can view monthly reports of bazar list, meal list and add other expenses (like: gas-bill, water-bill, etc.).
     2.You can view monthly details of total bazar, meal, room-mate.
#### Meal Details:
 If you are log in as manager you can view all   roommates meal details. and edit and update. No need to create new meal for a date because you find all date's row for a          month in there. If you log in as room-mates you can only view you meal data and cannot edit/update, you can send request message for changing you meal data to your manager.
